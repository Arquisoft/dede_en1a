== Building Block View
////
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

.Level 1

image:buildingBlock_level1.png["Building Block View Level 1"]

Motivation::

This figure shows the highest-level view of the DeDe application with its dependent databases.

1) DeDe::
Web Application that allows users to order products from an online store to their home in a decentralized manner. Connects to the user's Personal Online Datastore (POD) and the product database (hosted via MongoDB).

2) POD::
The user's Personal Online Data store, allows the app to be decentralized and only have access to the user's information when permitted by the user. Stores data such as the user's personal address, payment information, etc.

3) Product Databse::
Stores information of products (i.e. name, cost, description, availability, etc.). Built with MongoDB.

****

****

.Level 2

image:buildingBlock_level2.png["Building Block View Level 2"]

Motivation::

This figure shows the decomposition of the DeDe application into its frontend (WebApp) and backend (RestAPI), as well as the most important external libraries/frameworks that support each.

1) WebApp::
The WebApp is a web application which provides the user with an interface that allows them to view products, add them to a virtual shopping cart, login to their POD account, and checkout. Aside from displaying database information in a user friendly way, it also manages user requests and communicates with the backend to fulfill them.

2) RestAPI::
The restAPI defines DeDe's API in accordance with REST architecture, which allows DeDe to communicate with the product database and the user's POD. It also provides service to the WebApp so that the WebApp may grab information from the databases when necessary. Contains the models and business logic used to calculate delivery costs.

.Level 3

//image:BB_Level1.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

Motivation::

This figure shows the internal decomposition of DeDe's view (frontend), model (backend), and controllers. Each section details the components which are most essential to their functionality.

1) View (Frontend/WebApp)::
[cols="1,4" options="header"]
|===
| **Component** | **Responsibility**
| _App_ | _Root HTML component, encases all other visible components._
| _Cart_ | _Context which enables 'store' functionality across app._
| _Product Listing_ | _Context which enables 'store' functionality across app._
| _Checkout_ | _Endpoint for app requests to the backend._
| _Form_ | _Context which enables 'store' functionality across app._
|===

[cols="1,4" options="header"]
|===
| **Library** | **Responsibility**
| _Router_ | _React library which allows for paging and switching between views._
| _Axios_ | _React library which allows for API calls._
|===

[cols="1,4" options="header"]
|===
| **View** | **Responsibility**
| _Home_ | _Where products are listed in card format._
| _Product Details_ | _More detailed view of products. Includes product description_
| _Login_ | _Where user can login and access their POD._
| _Checkout_ | _Where user can pay for products._
|===

2) Model (Backend/RestAPI)::
[cols="1,4" options="header"]
|===
| **Software** | **Responsibility**
| _Cart_ | _Backend runtime environment where the TypeScript code runs._
| _Navbar_ | _JavaScript library used to build user interface._
| _Checkout_ | _Endpoint for app requests to the backend._
| _Product Details_ | _Node library for API building._
| _Helpers_ | _JS library for SOLID (POD) support._
| _Hooks_ | _JS library for MongoDB connections and integration._
|===

3) Controllers (Backend)::
The controllers interlink the frontend and the backend

Important Interfaces::
_<Description of important interfaces>_

[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.
****


==== <Name black box 1>

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

_<Purpose/Responsibility>_

_<Interface(s)>_

_<(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics>_

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_




==== <Name black box 2>

_<black box template>_

==== <Name black box n>

_<black box template>_


==== <Name interface 1>

...

==== <Name interface m>



=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

==== White Box _<building block 1>_

[role="arc42help"]

...describes the internal structure of _building block 1_.

_<white box template>_

==== White Box _<building block 2>_


_<white box template>_

...

==== White Box _<building block m>_

=== Level 3

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.
