== System Scope and Context

The application we have developed, DeDe, is an online retail system whose first priority is its clients privacy. In order to achieve this goal we use a new decentralized technology called SOLID where users store their data in POD's, hence they are in control of the information.


=== Business Context

When the user finishes selecting what products to buy and proceeds to create an order,
the system will require a login from SOLID in order to use their address, which is located in the POD, and be able to calculate the cost of the delivery.

=== Technical Context

The user will execute the application and will interact with the GUI in order to choose what products to buy. When the selection is done and the client wants to make an order the application will require them to Log in its Pod. Following this, the backend will manage the necessary interactions with the user's POD and the product database in order to provide an estimated cost of delivery and compute the total cost of the order.
