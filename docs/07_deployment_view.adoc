Motivation::

The DeDe Deals application is deployed in accordance with goals of continuous integration and adherance to SOLID design principles. In addition, hosting the application on a remote server allows it to be accessible from the Internet, from any place in the world.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

Hosting the application on the AWS cloud platform allows for continuous integration, so the application is automatically updated as new developments are committed.

Utilizing the user's POD following SOLID design principles allows the application to be decentralized.
