== Design Decisions

Here we will document the technologies that affect the application, and we will be explaining why below.

=== MongoDB
[discrete]
===== Context
While user data will always be accessed from their PODs and never stored, there is still some data the application handles which needs to be stored, such as product information and order placements. For this purpose, we will use MongoDB, since the format it uses is readily translatable to JavaScript objects.

=== Nominatim
[discrete]
===== Context
To calculate the distance between the warehouse and the user address we make use of the Nominatim library. It offers us a simple and easy way of calculating the distances.

=== JWT Token
[discrete]
===== Context
To create user authorization we make use of JWT tokens, which securely store a privileged session.
