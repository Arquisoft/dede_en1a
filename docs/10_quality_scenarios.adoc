== Quality Requirements
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios.

Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural decisions we should know for every
stakeholder what is really important to them, concrete and measurable.

We have already talked about quality goals in https://https://dedeen2awebapp.herokuapp.com/docs/#_quality_goals[section 1.2], but in this section we will expand on that topic, using
a quality tree (provides an overview of the attributes) and some quality scenarios (describe what happens when a stimulus arrives at the system).

=== Quality Scenarios

Here we have an initial table with our quality goals, scenarios, priorities and difficulty:

* Quality goal: quality measurable subject which needs to reach a target level.
* Scenario: description of the system behaviour and helps the measure of quality.
* Priority: priority in the development of the application.
* Difficulty: difficulty to archive the quality goal.

|===
|Quality goal|Scenario|Priority|Difficulty
| Privacy | Private data from the users has to be protected and secure. The application only takes essential data from the user, and in a decentralized approach. | High | High
| Usability |  Users have to be able to navigate through the application in an intuitive way. | Medium | Medium
| Maintainability | The application should be written in a way that code can be reused and modified in a simple way, bugs can be easily found and fixed, and the program should be easy to test. | Medium | High
| Availability |  Users have to be able to use the application at any time any day. | High | High
